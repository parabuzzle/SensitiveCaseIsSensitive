This is an example of why filenames should always be lowercase when developing code.

I created this repo on Linux with two files named `MyCode` and `mycode`. If you clone this repository on Linux everything is the same, if you clone this on Mac you will lose one of the files.

This is because Linux is usually a Case-Sensitive file system and OSX is usually a Case-Insensitive file system. OSX assumes that `MyCode` and `mycode` are the same file.
